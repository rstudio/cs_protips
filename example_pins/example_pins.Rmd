# Purpose
This document provides a follow-along example of:  

* Creating a pin on RStudio Connect 
* Retrieving a pin from RStudio Connect 
* Publishing content that uses a pin to RStudio Connect  

# Prework
Prior to beginning, ensure you:  

1. Create an API key from RStudio Connect: [Learn How](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/user/api-keys/)  
2. Save your API key as a system environment variable. Example: `Sys.setenv("CONNECT_API_KEY" = "key value")`.
3. For convenience, save your RStudio Connect server address as a system environment variable as well. Example: `Sys.setenv("CONNECT_SERVER" = "https://your-server-address.com/")`

Important: Keep your API key secure! Set environment variables using the R Console; not as something saved in your script! 

# Creating a pin
Let's say we are running an important analysis that involves body temperature mesurements of beavers. Let's look at our data first.  

```{r}
library(datasets)
head(beaver1)
```

Nice looking data!

Now we want to pin this data to RStudio Connect so it is also accessible to our colleagues for their important work and we don't have to email this around as a csv file.  Let's get started!

## Register the board

First, **register the board** so your session knows that it can place content on your Connect board:

```{r}
# Pins will use CONNECT_API_KEY and CONNECT_SERVER by default,
# but we are being explicit here anyway.
pins::board_register("rsconnect",
               key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"),
               server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"))
```

After running the script above, did you see that the Connections pane in your RStudio IDE now shows the board `rsconnect`?  This gives you an easy way to browse your organization's pinned objects.  Here's what mine looks like:  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '65%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/connections_pane.png")
```
  
## Pin the data
 
Now we want to **pin our data** to RStudio Connect. 

_Before you run this code chunk_: Update the `name = "mydata"` parameter to give your pin a unique name identifier on the server.

```{r}
pins::pin(beaver1, name = "mybeaverdata", description = "Beaver Body Temperature Measurements", board = "rsconnect")

```

Take a moment to switch to the RStudio Connect content dashboard and give yourself a pat on the back. **Your data is now pinned!**

## Visit your new pin

From the dashboard, you can adjust the user access permissions, add collaborators, and even give your pin a custom content URL.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pinned_to_connect.png")
```

# Retrieving a pin  
Now let's pretend you're a colleague and you want to access this data for your own analysis.  

Feel free to put on a hat if it helps you to get into character. Keep in mind that your colleague won't have access to your environment with your API key -- this is by design! We don't recommend you share API keys with other people. For someone else to retrieve your pin, two things need to happen:

1. **_You need_** to give them permission by adjusting the **Access Settings** on your Pin in the RStudio Connect content dashboard.
2. **_They need_** to generate an API key from their own RStudio Connect account, just like you did way back in the **Prework** section. 
  
Okay, if we imagine that all of those things have taken place, let's get the dataset from RStudio Connect. 

In RStudio Connect, did you notice the header information on your pin?  This is present on every pin published to Connect and it provides the code to retrieve your pin in either R or Python.  Handy, huh?  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/retrieval_code.png")
```

So let's copy that code into our analysis and **retrieve the pin**. 

Replace the `# Retrieve Pin` code section below with the sample from your own pin:

```{r}
# Register RStudio Connect
library(pins)
pins::board_register("rsconnect",
               key = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY"),
               server = Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER"))

# Retrieve Pin
# beaver_data <- pin_get("your/pin", board = "rsconnect")
  
# View the pin locally
# head(beaver_data)
```

Jackpot! We have our data.

# Using pins in content 

So you think you're hot stuff and off and running?  For now, perhaps.  But let's say you want to publish something to RStudio Connect (like this RMD file), which uses pinned content in it.

## Try publishing

Go ahead, try **publishing this document to your RStudio Connect server** right now. 

Did you just get a big ugly error message?  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/env_var_error.png")
```

Stop cursing! This is one time that an error message is good. You've done everything correctly so far! 

This error is telling us that RStudio Connect can't find the environment variables. 

*"API keys again? I thought this was a `pins` lesson, not an API key lesson!"*  

Yes, so as alluded to in the previous section, we used our API key in the RStudio IDE session so that RStudio Connect could authenticate you acting through the IDE. This time, the `rstudio-connect` user needs an API key to access your pinned content.   

## Recover from the error

In the RStudio Connect content settings panel, select the **Vars** option and **create environment variables for `CONNECT_API_KEY` and `CONNECT_SERVER`** - values will appear in plain text until you hit **Save**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/add_env_vars.png")
```
  
Click the **Refresh Report** button to re-render your document with the new environment variables in place.  Hold breath... and... 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', out.extra = 'style="background-color: #447099; padding:5px;"'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/deploy_success.png")
```

Voilà!  Congratulations!  You're a pinning machine. **You've now deployed content that includes references to a pinned object.**
